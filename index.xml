      <description>Social Good We address problems within our society, communities and environment. We deliver alternative solutions for a fairer, safer and sustainable future.
Cooperation over Collaboration over Conflict Our view is that cooperation is better than the need to collaborate on everything and that collaboration is better than conflict. Our actions are often independent and are made with our shared values working towards shared goals. Acceptance of this in our decisions means our cooperation with each other.</description>
