      <description>We are using Trello here in whatever way comes to us:
 We set goals which are time bound and work towards a mission (of some sort, eg. Hitch my Ride Discovery). We use it to plan work together, assign and schedule it and then to review what weâ€™ve done. We make lists of things we might want to think about or need to address outside of actual tasks we are working on.</description>

      <description>This document describes how to edit the project wiki (this site), it is intended for those who contribute to Polydigital projects and want to post public information about their work.
Summary  We publish this site to Github Pages, essentially we are using github to host our static site.
 We generate the site using Hugo that builds Markdown into our static site. We use Github to maintain versions of both our markdown source and for the public generated site.</description>
